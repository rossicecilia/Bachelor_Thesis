# Polysomnography oriented to sleep analysis: Cleveland Family Study conversion and harmonization for electroencephalogram survey ​

Polysomnography (PSG) refers to a comprehensive monitoring system, based on simultaneous acquisition of different physiologic parameters during sleep, among which cerebral activity, eye movements, muscular tone, body position, hearth rate and rhythm. This procedure is primarily used to analyze and monitor sleep quality, to differentiate sleep phases and to diagnose potential sleep disorders, which appear as abnormal paths in the recorded signals. The aim of this thesis is the pre-processing, included the conversion and harmonization, of PSG signals from the Cleveland Family Study (CFS), with particular prominence given to arousals detection and sleep staging in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Developed results will be used in a wider project, which aim is to suggest a new index evaluating sleep depth, based on non-linear EEG measures. The long-term objective is to understand in which way derived measurements of the sleep intensity are sensible to EEG changes.  ​
